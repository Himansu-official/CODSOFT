# Customer Churn Prediction API

## Overview
This project provides an API for predicting customer churn based on various input features. It leverages machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest and XGBoost) to make predictions.

## Features
- **API Endpoints**: 
  - `/` - Base route to confirm the API is running.
  - `/predict` - Accepts customer data and returns a churn prediction.
  - **Pre-trained Models**: Includes optimized models like Random Forest and XGBoost for accurate predictions.
  - **User-friendly**: Simple JSON-based input and output.
- **Trained Models**: Includes pre-trained models for making predictions.
- **Well-Documented Code**: Scripts for preprocessing, training, and inference.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python 3.11
- **Framework**: Flask
- **Machine Learning Libraries**:
  - Scikit-learn
  - XGBoost
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
- **Other Tools**:
  - Matplotlib
  - Imbalanced-learn
